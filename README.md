# KMDB - KEA movie database
AngularJS class mandatory assignment.

## WIP
Project is built with Webpack. All js files are packed in one `bundle.js` file which is referenced
in index.html. Everything then is referenced via es6 module system.

Entry point is `/app/index.js`.
I am still experimenting with [component](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component) approach of building angular app and also
tried using [component router](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component-router).

## Run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
